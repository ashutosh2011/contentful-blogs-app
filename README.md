# Next.js Contentful Blog POC

This isn't just a "Hello World" project; it's a "Hello Universe" project. I've delved into the cosmic landscape of Contentful and Next.js to create this proof of concept. The aim is to showcase how you can integrate Contentful, a headless CMS, with Next.js, a React-based framework, to create a simple yet dynamic blog platform. Let's embark on this journey to discover the magic of Contentful integration.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**: To get this project up and running, run `npm install`.

2. **Set up Contentful**: Head over to Contentful and generate your Space ID and Access Tokens if you haven't already.

3. **Create Environment Variables**: Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add the following lines:

    ```sh
    CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID=your_space_id
    CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token
    ```

4. **Start the Project**: Run `npm run dev` to start the development server. Open `http://localhost:3000` to see the blog.

## üß© Project Architecture

This project consists of several key components:

- **app**: This is where the pages of the application are. Each file corresponds to a route in the application.
- **components**: These are the reusable UI components.
- **lib**: This is where utility functions, including API calls to Contentful, reside.
- **styles**: Contains global styles and utility classes.

## üåü Why Next.js?

I chose Next.js for several reasons:

- **Hybrid Static and Server Rendering**: Ideal for a blog platform that benefits from both speed and flexibility.
- **Pre-rendering**: Great for SEO and performance.
- **Automatic Code Splitting**: Faster page loads.
- **React**: It's built on React, which offers power and flexibility.

## üåå Why Contentful?

I chose Contentful because:

- **Scalability**: It can scale with my needs.
- **Performance**: Contentful's CDN ensures fast content delivery.
- **Developer Experience**: The API and documentation are straightforward.
- **Flexibility**: I can model content as needed.
- **Editor Experience**: The interface is easy to use.

## üó≥ Poll Feature

I've added a poll feature to this project! Now, not only can you read content, but you can also vote in various polls.

### How to Interact with the Poll Feature

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ List Polls

To get a list of available polls, send a GET request to `/api/listPolls`.

Example using `curl`:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/listPolls
```

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Cast a Vote

To vote, send a POST request to `/api/vote` with a JSON payload containing the `optionId`.

Example using `curl`:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/vote -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"optionId":"your_option_id_here"}'
```

### Environment Variables for Polls

Don't forget to add the Contentful Management API Access Token to the `.env.local` file:

```sh
CONTENTFUL_MANAGEMENT_API_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_management_api_token_here
```

This allows you to interact with the polls. Happy voting!

You can place this revised section at the bottom of your README to guide users on how to interact with the new poll feature.
